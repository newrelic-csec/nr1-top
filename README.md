# Top

![CI](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-top/workflows/CI/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-top?include_prereleases) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-top/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-top)

Top is a simple process monitor inspired by Unixâ€™s `top` command.

Top allows you to easily see and understand the CPU, I/O and memory of the processes on a given host.
